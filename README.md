# Resume, Blog, and Portfolio Web App

Welcome to my web application that combines my resume, blog, and portfolio into a single platform. This project demonstrates my frontend development skills and showcases my personal brand and work samples.

## Motivation

I chose to create this web app by combining my resume, blog, and portfolio into a single application to showcase my skills and expertise as a frontend developer. This project offers a holistic representation of my abilities and allows me to demonstrate my proficiency in various frontend technologies and practices. Additionally, I developed the API using Django REST Framework, leveraging my backend development skills to create a robust and secure foundation for the web app. By combining my resume, blog, and portfolio with the Django-powered API, I can provide potential employers and visitors with a seamless and interactive experience. This integration allows for dynamic data retrieval and manipulation, enabling users to explore my qualifications, read blog articles, and browse through my portfolio with ease. The consolidated design and functionality not only highlight my frontend development expertise but also showcase my ability to build end-to-end solutions that encompass both frontend and backend components. Through this project, I aim to exhibit my versatility as a full-stack developer and present a comprehensive representation of my professional identity.
